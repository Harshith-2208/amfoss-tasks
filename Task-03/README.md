# Approach and Review on Task
I knew Python and C before so I completed all the subtasks in Python and C. Anyways I managed to do 2 subtasks in C++,Elixir,Haskell,Javascript,Ruby,Rust and did 1 subtask in Java and Go.In this I learned basics like printing in many languages that I didn't heard of before. This was also one of the good takeaway task.
