# Approach and Review on Task 
In this task we need to fix a broken terminal for the customers to successfully purchase products from the hyper market. Even for this I have searched for some videos and learned how to do it. This task also involves the use of API i.e fake store API to get the details of the products available like images,product id ,etc. I have also taken the help of ChatGPT to learn the code and apply it in my case. This task was also time taking as I didn't know about js,html,css to this extent.
