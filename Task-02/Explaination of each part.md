# Explaination of each part

## Part 1:
Using cd and ls commands I found the parchment.txt file in Entrance3.I even used find command. I run the .txt file using cat command. Got the code and proceeded with part-2
## Part 2:
I got to know to switch between the realms by using git checkout <branch name> command. Finding Kharnok the Bloodforged and killing him with the holy spell found by using grep for finding two words holy and good . After finding the words with 'oo' replacing them with a alphabet before it and making a holyspell out of it to play the game. Then changing branch to dark realm and finding Celestial Veil Amulet. 
## Part 3:
After completing the first part(light book) of the book. I went into Dark realm(branch) and use Celestial Veil Amulet to unlock the chests found in branches Dark Realm I and II.
## Part 4:
Now I have combined 4 of the found codes and chests from each part and then decode it to get the link to a repo. Then I have cloned this repo to complete the task.
## Part-5:
I went through each of the commit and found the code in the third commit. I have decoded this and got final message that congratulates leading to the end of the task.
